The Mask Sorbonne Speech Corpus (MSSC) consists in 2,000 recorded sentences in German language. In order to measure speech changes caused by sound absorption by the mask material, we used an artificial voice generator held in a block of high-density foam. The voice generator was a micro bluetooth speaker (Bose Sound Link micro) located in an anechoid chamber. 1,000 sentences uttered by 30 speakers have been selected from a speech data corpus: the German Distant Speech Data Corpu. Kinect Direct Access recording conditions have been chosen and textual transcript was not used. The list of selected sentences is available here.
